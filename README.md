# Current status

```diff
- Hello you random bypasser! 

- Ilmomasiina is currently at alpha testing phase. You use it. Something breaks? You fix it.

- In case you're interested in development. We heavily recommend you to contact @peksi

```

Current defelopment is being held on `otax/production` branch.


# Ilmomasiina

Ilmomasiina is Athene's event registration system.

## Requirements

- Node.js `^8.9.4`
- npm `^5.6.0`
- MySQL `^8.0`

## MYSQL Setup (Mac)

1. Install `mysql` (8.x) with Homebrew (https://gist.github.com/nrollr/3f57fc15ded7dddddcc4e82fe137b58e)
2. Start the mysql service with `brew services start mysql`
3. Open the mysql terminal with `mysql -u root`
4. In the mysql terminal, create a new user e.g. `CREATE USER 'juuso'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`
5. Type `exit` to exit the mysql terminal, and sign in with your new user e.g. `mysql -u juuso -p password`
6. Create the `ilmomasiina` database with `CREATE DATABASE ilmomasiina;`

## Getting started

1. Create an `.env` file at the root of the project. For the contents of the .env file, check `ENV.MD`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

**Optional**: You can create mockup data for development by running `npm run create-fake-data`. During development, database can be resetted with `npm run reset-db`.

## Mailgun setup

Mailgun provides 10 000 free messages per month which is suitable for small projects. With minor changes sending mail could be also done via Sendgrid. Using your own mail server gets you labelled as spam pretty fast.

Add mailgun credentials to .env configuration.

### Create first admin user

Add this line to .env configuration.

```
ADMIN_REGISTRATION_ALLOWED=true
```

Create new user with POST request.

```
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{ "email": "ville@athene.fi", "password": "password" }'
```

**Important**: Disallow admin user creation by removing the line.

By default, only logged in admin users can create new admin users (via `/admin`).

## Production

**Important**: Ilmomasiina is currently on alpha stage. Use it with your own risk.

Example of `.htaccess` config:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^ilmo$ ilmo/ [NC,R=301,L]
    RewriteRule ^ilmo/$ http://0.0.0.0:2011/ [P,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^ilmo/(.*)$ http://0.0.0.0:2011/$1 [P,L]
</IfModule>
```

Example of relevant lines in .env file

```
BASE_URL=https://athene.fi
PREFIX_URL=/ilmo
PORT=2011
```

With some hosting providers (such as Otax) you might need to request the access to the port.
Running production version within pm2 is recommended

## Updating production

```
git pull otax/master
npm run compile
pm2 restart prod-server
```
